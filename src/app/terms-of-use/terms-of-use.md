Updated: May 7th, 2024

Welcome to ReLife. These are our terms of use, and they govern your use of ReLife and the other products, services, and software we offer (collectively, the “Service”). “We”, ”our,” or “us” refers to MeStyle's businesses. and our subsidiaries. “ReLife” refers to the Service. By using ReLife, you agree to these terms, our Privacy Policy, our Community Guidelines, and the other policies we post. Please read these terms carefully.


THESE TERMS CONTAIN AN ARBITRATION CLAUSE AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER THAT IMPACT YOUR RIGHTS ABOUT HOW TO RESOLVE DISPUTES. WE EXPLAIN MORE ABOUT ARBITRATION AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION, AND HOW YOU CAN OPT OUT OF ARBITRATION, BELOW.


## Who can use ReLife

You must be at least 13 years old to use ReLife. We will terminate any accounts used by underage users as determined in our sole discretion, including all content.


If you accept these terms or use ReLife on behalf of a business or entity, you represent and warrant you are authorized to do so and have the authority to bind that business or entity to these terms, in which case the words “you” and “your” in these terms include you and that business or entity.


## Privacy

Our Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, share, or otherwise process information about you and your use of the Service.


### Abusive conduct

You are responsible for all activity on your account. Don’t do anything illegal, abuse others, or misuse the Service. If you violate our policies we may suspend your access to certain features or terminate your account. 


## Subscription and billing

### Packages and Fees


Much of the Service is free of charge, which we refer to as “ReLife Basic”. We also offer plans that provide access to enhanced services and additional ReLife Content for a fee (a “Package”). You may purchase a Package directly from us or through a third party, such as the iOS App Store or Google Play. If you purchase a Package from a third party, separate terms and conditions with such third party in addition to these terms may apply to your access to the Service.


Your payment to us or the third party through which you purchased the Package will automatically renew (a “Subscription”), if it is under subscription model (not a one-off service), and continue until terminated. You must cancel your Subscription before it renews in order to avoid paying the subscription fees for the next billing period (see “Cancellation and Refunds” below). We reserve the right to modify, terminate, or otherwise amend the Package and Subscription plans we offer from time to time. If you have purchased a Subscription, we will give you advance notice of significant changes to your plan.


Unless we specify that your Subscription includes use of the Service by multiple users, your Subscription is for a single user only. You may not share your Subscription with anyone else, and you may access and use your Subscription on up to ten devices on a single operating system.


### Payment Method


Unless otherwise indicated, you are required to provide a credit card or other payment method that we, or the third party through which you purchased the Subscription, accept to pay the applicable fee for a Package or a Subscription. We or such third party will charge the payment method you’ve chosen a fee plus any applicable taxes on a recurring basis corresponding to the term of your Package or Subscription. You are solely responsible for any and all fees charged to the payment method you’ve chosen. We reserve the right to cancel your Package or Subscription if we are unable to successfully charge your payment method.


### Billing Period for Subscription


We or the third party from who you purchased a Subscription will automatically bill you using the payment method you’ve chosen on the day you start your Subscription or the day your free Trial ends (see “Free Trials and Promotions” below), as applicable, and on each recurring billing date thereafter. Your “billing period” is the interval of time between each recurring billing date and corresponds to the term of your Subscription. If your Subscription renews on a date not contained in a given month, then we will charge you on the last day of such month.


The amount you are billed and billing date may vary to account for a free Trial, promotional offers, account credits, and changes in your Subscription or payment method. You authorize us to charge you for these varying amounts, if any.


### Cancellation and Refunds


The purchased Package is unable to cancel, whereas you can cancel your Subscription by signing in to your account and following the instructions for canceling your Subscription. If you purchased your Subscription through a third party, such as the Apple App Store or Google Play, you may need to cancel through that third party.


If you cancel your Subscription, you will continue to have access to the applicable Service and any Content you created through the end of your current billing period. Your account will be downgraded to ReLife Basic at the end of the billing period.


All payments are nonrefundable. If you cancel your Subscription, or if your account is terminated under these terms, you will not receive a refund or credit, including for partial periods of service.


### Free Trials and Promotions


From time to time, we or others on our behalf may offer trials of Subscriptions for a specified period without payment or at a reduced rate (a "Trial"). We may determine your eligibility for a Trial, and withdraw or modify a Trial at any time without prior notice and with no liability, to the extent permitted under applicable law.


For some Trials, we'll require you to provide your payment details to start the Trial. By providing such details, you agree that we may automatically begin charging you for a Subscription on the first day following the end of the Trial on a recurring monthly basis or another interval that we disclose to you in advance. TO AVOID PAYING THIS CHARGE, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE SUBSCRIPTION BEFORE THE END OF THE TRIAL. IF YOU RECEIVED YOUR TRIAL THROUGH A THIRD PARTY, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE SUBSCRIPTION THROUGH THE THIRD PARTY.

## Disclaimers and limitations of liability

### No Warranties


THE SERVICE AND RELIFE CONTENT ARE PROVIDED “AS IS,” “AS AVAILABLE” AND “WITH ALL FAULTS." WE MAKE NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY, AS TO: (A) THE SERVICE; (B) RELIFE CONTENT; (C) ANY CONDUCT OR CONTENT OF ANY USER ON THE SERVICE; OR (D) SECURITY ASSOCIATED WITH THE TRANSMISSION OF INFORMATION TO RELIFE OR VIA THE RELIFE SERVICES. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, WE SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIM ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.


WE DO NOT WARRANT OR GUARANTEE THAT THE SERVICE IS ACCURATE, RELIABLE OR CORRECT; THAT THE SERVICE WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS; THAT THE SERVICE WILL BE AVAILABLE AT ANY PARTICULAR TIME OR LOCATION, UNINTERRUPTED, ERROR-FREE, WITHOUT DEFECT, OR SECURE; THAT USER CONTENT MARKED AS PRIVATE WILL NOT BECOME PUBLIC; THAT ANY DEFECTS OR ERRORS WILL BE CORRECTED; OR THAT THE SERVICE IS FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS.


### Limitation of Liability


TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ReLife, ITS AFFILIATES, LICENSORS, SPONSORS, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AND AGENTS (THE “RELIFE PARTIES”) SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES, WHETHER INCURRED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, USE, GOODWILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, RESULTING FROM (i) YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF OR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICES; (ii) ANY CONDUCT OR CONTENT OF ANY THIRD PARTY ON THE SERVICES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY DEFAMATORY, OFFENSIVE OR ILLEGAL CONDUCT OF OTHER USERS OR THIRD PARTIES; (iii) ANY CONTENT OBTAINED OR GENERATED FROM THE SERVICES; OR (iv) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, USE OR ALTERATION OF YOUR TRANSMISSIONS OR CONTENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE RELIFE PARTIES’ AGGREGATE LIABILITY EXCEED THE GREATER OF ONE HUNDRED U.S. DOLLARS (U.S. $100.00) OR THE AMOUNT YOU PAID RELIFE, IF ANY, IN THE PAST SIX MONTHS FOR THE SERVICES GIVING RISE TO ANY AND ALL CLAIMS. THE LIMITATIONS OF THIS SUBSECTION SHALL APPLY TO ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, STATUTE, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE, AND WHETHER OR NOT THE RELIFE PARTIES HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH DAMAGE, AND EVEN IF A REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.


### Indemnity and Release for Your Use


You agree to release, indemnify and hold us, our affiliates, officers, employees, directors, agents, successors and assigns (collectively, “ReLife Parties” and each an “Indemnitee”) harmless from any and all losses, liabilities, damages, fines, penalties, expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs), rights, claims, and actions of any kind and any injury arising out of or relating to: (1) your past and present use of the Service or any of its tools, features or functions, including any tools that apply effects to, or generate images of, individuals, (2) any Content you upload to the Service or create with the Service, or (3) your violation of these terms, any rights of another person or applicable law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you will have no obligation to indemnify or hold harmless any Indemnitee from or against any liability, losses, damages or expenses incurred as a direct result of any action or inaction of such Indemnitee. If you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which says: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor or releasing party does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release and that, if known by him or her, would have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor or released party.” If you are a resident of another jurisdiction, you waive any comparable statute or doctrine.


## General

### Governing Law


These terms and our Privacy Policy are governed by the laws of the State of California without giving effect to any conflicts of laws principles. However, some countries (including those in the European Union) have laws that require agreements to be governed by the local laws of the consumer's country. This paragraph doesn’t override those laws.


### Judicial Forum For Disputes


You agree that any judicial proceeding to resolve a Claim (as defined below) will be brought in the federal or state courts of San Francisco County, California, subject to the mandatory arbitration provisions below. Both you and we consent to venue and personal jurisdiction in such courts. If you reside in a country with laws that give consumers the right to bring disputes in their local courts (for example, a member state of the European Union), this paragraph doesn’t affect that right.


### Dispute Resolution


You agree that in the event of any dispute between you and us (including any disputes between you and a third-party agent of ours), you will first contact us and make a good faith effort to resolve the dispute before resorting to more formal means of resolution, including without limitation any court action, and that you will describe clearly the basis and nature of your dispute together with the specific facts that support your position. Notwithstanding anything in this Dispute Resolution section to the contrary, ReLife may seek legal and equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to protect its intellectual property rights and those of its suppliers.


In the event a dispute cannot be resolved through communications with us, you agree that any claim, counterclaim, controversy, or other disputes between you and us or you and a third-party agent of ours (a "Claim") shall be resolved through final and binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") under its Consumer Arbitration Rules ("AAA Rules"), and such Claims shall be resolved in San Francisco, California. This Dispute Resolution Provision applies to any existing or future Claims that you have not individually filed in a court of law prior to the date you agreed to these terms, including but not limited to claims relating to these terms, our Privacy Policy, your account with the Service, and your use of the Service and the features made available through the Service. All equitable and legal remedies that would be available in a federal, state, or local court will be available in arbitration, except that if either party seeks a public injunction, that claim or prayer for private injunctive relief must be adjudicated by a federal, state, or local court and not the arbitrator.


The arbitration will be heard and determined by a single arbitrator. You and we agree that the arbitration proceedings will be kept confidential and that the existence of the proceeding and any element of it (including, without limitation, any pleadings, briefs or other documents submitted or exchanged and any testimony or other oral submissions and awards) will not be disclosed beyond the arbitration proceedings, except as may lawfully be required in judicial proceedings relating to the arbitration, by applicable disclosure rules and regulations of securities regulatory authorities or other governmental agencies, or as specifically permitted by state law. Judgment on any award entered by the arbitrator may be enforced in any court having jurisdiction. Any cause of action brought by you against us, or our affiliates, officers, directors, or agents, must be instituted within one (1) year after the cause of action arises or be deemed forever waived and barred.


The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court, will have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, unconscionability, arbitrability, enforceability, or formation of this Dispute Resolution section, including any Claim that all or any part of it is void or voidable. The arbitrator's decision in any such arbitration will be final and binding upon the parties and may be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction. If any provision of this Dispute Resolution section is found unenforceable, the unenforceable provision will be severed, and the remaining arbitration terms will be enforced (but in no case will there be a class or representative arbitration).


ANY ARBITRATION UNDER THESE TERMS BY EITHER YOU OR US WILL ONLY BE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS; CLASS ARBITRATIONS, CLASS ACTIONS, REPRESENTATIVE ACTIONS, AND CONSOLIDATION WITH OTHER ARBITRATIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED. YOU WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO HAVE YOUR CASE DECIDED BY A JURY AND YOU WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION AGAINST US. YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OPT OUT OF ARBITRATION AS EXPLAINED BELOW.


ReLife will reimburse you for your payment of any filing fees or arbitrator fees in connection with an arbitration that you commence, provided that you have followed the dispute resolution process noted above. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your Claim or the relief sought by you in arbitration was frivolous, or a Claim was brought by you for an improper purpose or without supporting facts, the parties may seek to re-allocate the fees and costs of arbitration, according to the rules of the arbitration provider. Each party shall bear the cost of their own attorneys’ fees, except that attorneys’ fees can be awarded by the arbitrator to the prevailing party if expressly authorized by statute. You agree that the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law govern this provision. This Dispute Resolution provision will survive any termination of these terms. You and we also have the right to bring qualifying claims in small claims court or transfer qualifying claims to small claims court.


Neither you nor we may act as a class representative or private attorney general, nor participate as a member of a class of claimants, with respect to any Claim. You may not bring Claims in arbitration on a class, consolidated or representative basis. The arbitrator can decide only your and/or our individual Claims. The arbitrator may not consolidate or join the claims of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated without prior written consent of the parties. The arbitrator may award in the arbitration the same damages or other relief available under applicable law, including injunctive and declaratory relief, as if the action were brought in court on an individual basis. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing or herein, the arbitrator or court may issue a “public injunction”. If either party seeks a “public injunction,” all other claims and prayers for relief must be adjudicated in arbitration first and any prayer or claim for a “public injunction” in federal or state court stayed until the arbitration is completed, after which the federal or state court can adjudicate the party’s claim or prayer for “public injunctive relief.” In doing so, the federal or state court is bound under principles of claim or issue preclusion by the decision of the arbitrator.


THIS SECTION LIMITS CERTAIN RIGHTS, INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO MAINTAIN A COURT ACTION, THE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL, AND THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY FORM OF CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE CLAIM.


### Mass Arbitration Process Requirements


If twenty-five (25) or more similar claims are asserted against us by the same or coordinated counsel or are otherwise coordinated (and your Claim is one such claim), you understand and agree that the resolution of your dispute might be delayed. You also agree to the following process and application of the AAA Multiple Consumer Case Filing Fee Schedule and Supplementary Rules. Counsel for the claimants and our counsel shall each select ten (10) cases (per side) to proceed first in individual arbitration proceedings as part of a bellwether process. The remaining cases shall not be filed or deemed filed in arbitration nor shall any AAA fees be assessed in connection with those claims until they are selected to proceed to individual arbitration proceedings as part of a staged process. If the parties are unable to resolve the remaining cases after the conclusion of the initial twenty (20) proceedings, the parties shall participate in a global mediation session before a retired state or federal court judge, and we will pay the mediator's fee. If the parties are unable to resolve the remaining matters through mediation at this time, then each side shall select twenty (20) cases (per side) to proceed to individual arbitration proceedings as part of a second bellwether process. (If there are fewer than forty (40) claims remaining, all shall proceed.) The remaining cases shall not be filed or deemed filed in arbitration nor shall any AAA fees be assessed in connection with those cases until they are selected to proceed to individual arbitration proceedings as part of a staged process. A single arbitrator shall preside over each case. Only one case may be assigned to each arbitrator as part of a bellwether process unless the parties agree otherwise. If the parties are unable to resolve the remaining cases after the conclusion of the forty (40) proceedings, the parties shall participate in another global mediation session before a retired state or federal court judge, and we will pay the mediator's fee. If the parties are unable to resolve the remaining matters in mediation at this time, this staged process shall continue with one hundred (100) cases proceeding at one time that are selected randomly or by the AAA in staged sets, until all the claims included in these coordinated filings, including your case, are adjudicated or otherwise resolved. Between staged sets of proceedings, we agree to participate in a global mediation session should your counsel request it in an effort to resolve all remaining claims. The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled for claims subject to this section regarding “Disputes” from the time the first cases are selected for a bellwether process until the time your case is selected, withdrawn, or otherwise resolved. A court of competent jurisdiction shall have authority to enforce this paragraph and, if necessary, to enjoin the mass filing or prosecution of arbitration demands against us. Should a court of competent jurisdiction decline to enforce these " Mass Arbitration Process Requirements," you and we agree that your and our counsel shall engage in good faith with the assistance of a Process Arbitrator to devise and implement procedures that ensure that arbitration remains efficient and cost-effective for all parties. Either party may engage with the AAA to address reductions in arbitration fees.


### Severability


If any part of these terms is held invalid or unenforceable, that portion will be construed in a manner consistent with applicable law to reflect, as nearly as possible, the original intentions of the parties, and the remaining portions will remain in full force and effect.


### Waiver


Any failure by us to enforce or exercise any provision of these terms or related rights will not constitute a waiver of that right or provision.


### Opt-Out Notice


If you do not wish to resolve disputes by binding arbitration, you may opt out. If you do so, neither you nor ReLife can force the other to arbitrate. Within 30 days following your initial agreement to these terms, or the date of the last material update to the “Dispute Resolution” section of these terms, you can elect to opt out of the arbitration provisions of these terms by notifying ReLife in writing. Your notice must include your name and address, your ReLife username and the email address you used to set up your ReLife account, and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of arbitration to resolve disputes.


### Notices


You agree that we may provide disclosures and notices required by law and other information about your ReLife account to you electronically, by posting it on our website, pushing notifications through the Service, or by emailing it to the email address listed in your ReLife account. Electronic disclosures and notices have the same meaning and effect as if we had provided you with paper copies, and such disclosures will constitute notice to you at the time of publication.


### Changes to These Terms


We may modify these terms at any time. If we make any material changes, we’ll notify you as described in the “Notices” section above; if you continue to use the Service after that, you will be deemed to have accepted the changes. If you object to any change, your only recourse will be to terminate your ReLife account and stop using the Service.


### Notices for third party licensed content
